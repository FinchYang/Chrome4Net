# Chrome4Net
Google Chrome C# Package

This package contains implementation of Google Chrome Native Messaging protocol. Both synchronous and asynchronous I/O methods are provided.

## JSON
Since Google Chrome native messages are essentially javascript objects stringified into JSON, JSON.NET framework https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json may appear useful to process them.

I hope that the package will appear useful to you and able to save you some time.
